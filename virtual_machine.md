# Virtual Environment
We are using Vagrant to create a virtual environment through a vegrantfile, which will be created in the local host. In order for Vagrant to create a virtual machine we need VirtualBox, which all together will provide information to the Virtual machine to run.

# how to set up internet on VM?

- to make sure that we have internet available from our local host
- 'sudo apt-get update'. if this does not work, 'exit' the vagrant and do 'vagrant reload'
- 'sudo apt-get upgrade'

---

# Vagrant commands
- to boot up vagrant - 'vagrant up'
- to delete vagrant - 'vagrant destroy'
- to pause vagrant - 'vagrant halt


---

Whenever we add new functionality to our vagrant file that means we need to let the virtual box know there are new sets of commands so that it can implement those instructions inside the VM. There are two options we either do 'vagrant up' followed by 'vagrant destroy' so that it reboots with the newly added data or we can do 'vagrant reload' which is quicker (if this doesnâ€™t work use the other options). When we do vagrant reload, what happens is that vagrant goes to the local machine starts to read the vagrantfile pickup the ip address and tells virtualbox to inject this ip into this virtual machine to use the network available in the localhost.

### Automate process
in vagrant we will write a script that contains a set of commands (instruction) from the user to OS, the script is called provision.sh using 'nano provision.sh' - update - upgrade - install nginx - enable nginx
